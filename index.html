					<h3>Our Story</h3>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<div class="quote">
						<blockquote>
							"Tu de este lado y yo del otro como dos remos"
						</blockquote>
						<em>Trans.</em>
						<blockquote>
							"You on one side and I on the other, like two oars"
						</blockquote>
					</div>
					<p>
						This verse is featured in Love Park in Lima, Peru,
						which was conceived by Peruvian poet Antonio
						Cill&oacute;niz.  Chris and Laura visited the park in
						2009 after graduating from Harvard together, and they
						continue to be amazed at how appropriately the quote
						they discovered there applies to their relationship.
						Both active in the intramural sports community in
						college, Chris and Laura became friends while
						co-captaining the Lowell House crew team--their heads
						together planning boat lineups, early morning workouts
						on the Charles River, and big team breakfasts
						characterized their first interactions together. It was
						one such early morning in 2008 when Chris asked Laura
						to Lowell's spring formal, the Bacchanalia.
					</p>
					<p>
						The happy couple has been together ever since, their
						relationship growing and flourishing with equal support
						and love from port and starboard sides. Together for
						three years in Cambridge and Boston, they parted ways
						to pursue higher education in Atlanta and
						Philadelphia-- Chris on one side of the Mason Dixon
						Line and Laura on the other-- and after two years they
						emerged even stronger and more resolute in their love.
						They are so excited to begin their Happily Ever After--
						together again, at last-- in the city of Atlanta,
						Georgia, where they will remain until Chris completes
						his MD/PhD at Emory University.

					<li>
						<header>
							<img src="images/wedding-party/david.jpg" />
							<h4>Davey Lewis</h4>
							<h5>The Best Man</h5>
						</header>
						<p>David has known Chris for, well, the entirety of his
						whole life. As the youngest of the Lewis kids, Dave
						always received the best hand-me-down clothes, toys and
						Tupperware cups, but he's never let it faze him. Dave
						and Chris were extremely close growing up, and took
						turns name-calling, wrestling, or punching one another
						for most of their childhood. In fact, all three Lewis
						brothers were closely involved in the extraction of one
						another's teeth, fracturing of arms and perennial
						skinning of knees. But with that came brotherly lessons
						in reading, math, and computer games, handed down from
						Jake to Chris, and Chris to Dave. As the years tacked
						on, Chris and Dave matured from big/little brothers to
						just 2 bros, roaming the halls of WeyHigh together,
						running on its track team and sharing a big group of
						friends. When Chris was in Cambridge, there was one guy
						he could always turn to for help&mdash;with anything
						from laundry, to a ride, moving beds or couches. Dave
						is always there for Chris, an ever-present force of
						strength, love and hilarity. It's for these reasons the
						D-star is truly The Best Man.</p>
					</li>

						<header>
							<img src="images/wedding-party/alex-b.jpg">
							<h4>Alexandra Bassett</h4>
							<h5>Bride's Maid of Honor</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Laura is so excited to have Alexandra as her Maid of
						Honor. The two have been best friends for the past
						twelve years, starting in Fort Lauderdale where they
						went to high school together and were on the same State
						Champion eight on their crew team. Through college they
						kept up their relationship between Boston and
						Brunswick, Maine, by visiting each other every
						semester, sharing in many great adventures. Laura was
						delighted when Alexandra moved to Boston after
						graduation, where they were able to continue their
						adventuring&mdash;often with the addition of Chris and
						his friends! Alexandra is currently in her fourth year
						at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, and is
						definitely the most exciting dentist Laura knows. She
						enjoys skiing black diamonds, hiking 14'ers, and indoor
						rock climbing, and still finds time for her favorite
						stationary passion, studio art.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<header>
							<img src="images/wedding-party/alec.jpg" />
							<h4>Alec Jones</h4>
							<h5>Groomsman of the O.E.</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Since they first met as radio DJs for 95.3 WHRB,
						Alec and Chris have bonded like best bros. Their
						legendary exploits include traveling to the highest
						mountaintops of Hong Kong to contemplate the wisdom of
						the Buddha, traversing the catacombs of ancient Rome,
						where lay the earthly remains of saints and martyrs,
						and betting it all on a game of blackjack in Macau
						(they lost). For the moment, Alec is based in Allston
						and has promised that he'll be standing at Chris's side
						as he embarks on a new life adventure.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<header>
							<img src="images/wedding-party/alix.jpg" />
							<h4>Alexandra Kress</h4>
							<h5>Bride's Maid of the Big Sky</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Laura is absolutely delighted to have her dear
						friend Alix in her bridal party. Laura and Alix met at
						PennDesign, where Alix's creative side kept Laura
						focused on the details, and her stoic personality kept
						Laura grounded during late nights in the lab or
						studio&mdash;especially during the last month of
						thesis! Both committed in long distance relationships,
						Alix and Laura were often spotted on coffee dates or
						long walks, comparing notes on cute things to send
						their boyfriends. Both girls have since closed the gaps
						in their romantic relationships, moving to fun new
						cities for their wonderful men, and are so excited
						about each other's new lives! Alix is currently working
						at a Design/Build firm, and in her free time she enjoys
						photography, ice cream, and being in the great
						outdoors&mdash;all of which are available in abundance
						in Bozeman, Montana.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<header>
							<img src="images/wedding-party/andrew-k.jpg" />
							<h4>Andrew Keegan</h4>
							<h5>Groomsman of the Wood-Axe</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Upon first meeting, Chris set Andrew's shoes adrift
						into a classmate's pool, in an effort to&#8230;well
						actually, no one's really sure why that happened.
						Irregardless, they somehow became friends in History,
						and found themselves together in nearly every class for
						the remainder of high school. During movie nights at
						McKinley Road, drama practice for Godspell, and study
						sessions at Panera, the two became fast friends,
						surrounded by an amazing group of people forever known
						as Weytown.net. In college, Chris and Andrew never
						balked at biking from Cambridge to Chestnut Hill in the
						middle of the night&mdash;unless of course the 86 was
						actually on time. From Kostka to the Leam, Pennypacker
						to Lowell House, Keegan and Lewis were an inseparable
						duo, (in)famously known by denizens of every campus.
						After graduation, as roommates in Cambridge, Brighton
						and Southie, their girlfriends became fast friends,
						too, forming what remains as the best double-date combo
						in existence. Chris and Laura are honored, and so
						excited, to have them both in our wedding party,
						symbolic of the love and support we've all shared
						together.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<header>
							<img src="images/wedding-party/christy.jpg" />
							<h4>Christine Beckman</h4>
							<h5>Bride's Maid of the Mountains</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Christy and Laura met during orientation week at
						PennDesign, where they were fortuitously assigned to
						the same group to hunt for a drawing subject: in this
						case, a cute Philadelphia rowhouse. Their drawing
						skills grew immensely after that first week, and so did
						their friendship. The pair partnered up in virtually
						every class from that day on, as labmates and measuring
						partners, and learned a thing or two from each other as
						well! Christy's adventurous nature succeeded in
						bringing Laura out from under her graduate-school rock
						many a weekend, and together they explored
						Philadelphia's touristy attractions and delicious
						culinary offerings. Christy enjoys anything that has to
						do with mountains (she recently moved back to Colorado,
						her home) and is an excellent baker&mdash;Laura still
						dreams about Christy's homemade pretzels and doughnuts,
						and is so excited to have Christy's smiling face next
						to her on her wedding day!</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<header>
							<img src="images/wedding-party/andrew-l.jpg" />
							<h4>Andrew Lacombe</h4>
							<h5>Groomsman de la Combe</h5>
						</header>
						<p>The first time Andrew and Chris met was at the
						Lacombe's Thanksgiving dinner of 2008, which went as
						you might expect for a younger bro meeting the dude
						that's dating his sister. Chris was dressed to impress,
						but Andrew was not easily won over with his sister's
						best interests in mind. As the years drew on, and it
						seemed like Chris and Laura were pretty serious, brief
						conversations between the two dudes began to grow
						longer. It turned out they liked a lot of the same
						music, had seen the same bands live, and shared hobbies
						like skateboarding and winter sports. Since Andrew
						began college, the two guys have been able to swap more
						stories, exchange ideas and hang together at family
						gatherings. As they become family, each is sure it'll
						be an adventure, with the promise of many more memories
						to share.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<header>
							<img src="images/wedding-party/erica-d.jpg" />
							<h4>Erica Dee</h4>
							<h5>Bride's Maid of the Three Broomsticks</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Erica and Laura first became friends in sophomore
						English class, basking in the praise of their teacher
						who clearly favored rowers to the other high school
						students. They were brought together by their shared
						enthusiasm for fantasy novels and punk rock&mdash; in
						High school they were the oldest kids dressed up for
						each Harry Potter midnight book release party, and the
						coolest kids at the beach the next morning, eating ice
						cream and comparing notes on the last few chapters.
						They quickly grew out of their spiky bracelets and
						ripped jeans, but their relationship&mdash;and book
						recommendations&mdash;continue to this day, with
						frequent visitations between New York and Boston, New
						York and Philly, and now New York and Atlanta. A
						Manhattan convert after four years at NYU, Laura thinks
						Erica likely will remain in the city forever&mdash;but
						she still maintains that Boston is "a nice place to
						visit sometimes." Laura is absolutely delighted that
						Erica will be next to her on her big day.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<header>
							<img src="images/wedding-party/michael.jpg" />
							<h4>Mike Kenneally</h4>
							<h5>Groomsman of the Board 'n' Sword</h5>
						</header>
						<p>The first time Chris biked to East Weymouth, with a
						skateboard strapped to his back to make a documentary
						on leaf-boarding, he could not have imagined the force
						of nature about to be unleashed. It was hardly the last
						time Mike and Chris would roam through town, toting a
						backpack-VCR-camcorder filming one hijink or another.
						Like Andrew and the Weytown Crew, Kennea11y and Lewis
						were inseparable bros from the beginning of highschool,
						and they constantly engaged in discourse over the
						Divided Sky vs YEM, Flaming Lips vs Deathcab and Phish
						vs (no comparison). Despite attending college nearly
						100 miles apart, they were both frequent visitors on
						each other's campus, developing and sharing close
						friends at each. Their friendship was further tempered
						on epic roadtrips like Bonnaroo, and less-epic sojourns
						to Falmouth, Maine and the Wellfleet OysterFest. When
						Kenneals moved back to the 617, the Weymos rejoiced and
						merry was made, from South Boston to 3 memorable years
						in Allston. Always a huge fan of Laura from the
						beginning, Chris is proud to have this broseph stand by
						his side on the day of their wedding.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<header>
							<img src="images/wedding-party/erika-b.jpg" />
							<h4>Erika Boltz</h4>
							<h5>Bride's Maid of the Lost Diadem</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Erika and Laura were brought together in 2009 by
						their goofy boyfriends, Andrew and Christopher, who had
						been friends since childhood. When Andrew and Chris
						moved in together after graduating from college, they
						had no idea that it would have such wonderful
						consequences, but when the girls met it was basically
						love at first sight. Erika and Laura both share a
						healthy love of dogs, vegetables, and cute
						apartments&mdash;attributes which have arguably made
						their boyfriends' lives much better! They are both
						waiting patiently for Andrew and Chris to bring home
						nice canines to make their lives complete. Erika and
						Andrew have recently moved to the Chicago area (back to
						Erika's home state!) and Laura and Chris are elated
						that their favorite double-date couple will be
						brightening their wedding party all the way from the
						Midwest.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<header>
							<img src="images/wedding-party/shane.jpg" />
							<h4>Shane White</h4>
							<h5>Groomsman of the South</h5>
						</header>
						<p>When Shane and Chris met in their first week of
						college, they both knew they'd become the fastest of
						friends. Each of them with long, shaggy hair, and
						dialects that were at times incomprehensible to their
						classmates, they began a bromance that has stood the
						test of time. Fast-talking New Englander and drawling
						Tennessean, in time they realized they were more alike
						than different, studying Romance languages and the
						pre-med sciences, pursuits that enabled both to travel
						and visit each other in Spain and Italy. After
						graduating college, the two worked at medical research
						labs in Longwood, meeting often for lunch, or a tour of
						each other's mouse facilities. When Dixie called Shane
						back to UTennessee med school, they bid adieu, but it
						was not long until Chris found his own way to the Deep
						South. Despite the stresses of grad school, Shane and
						Chris have always found to time visit Memphis,
						Knoxville and Atlanta, swapping stories of flow
						cytometry and transplant medicine, or to test out a
						newly-sighted hunting rifle at the range. As Shane
						looks toward his Internal Medicine residency, he's
						promised that come hell or high glucose, he'll be there
						to watch Laura marry his best bro.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<header>
							<img src="images/wedding-party/kirsten.jpg" />
							<h4>Kirsten Harmon</h4>
							<h5>Bride's Maid of the Valley</h5>
						</header>
						<p>Laura is thrilled that her oldest friend Kirsten
						will be in her wedding party. The two have been friends
						since they were five years old&mdash;the day they met,
						their moms found them holding hands on the stairs of
						the church auditorium. They soon became inseparable,
						growing up together like sisters and sharing all kinds
						of happy memories, like playing soccer, softball and
						dress-up, singing and dancing in musicals, and going to
						sleep away camp for the first time. After Laura moved
						away from California, the two continued to lead
						parallel lives in their academic interests and travel
						destinations&mdash;both minored in Latin American
						Studies and have traveled extensively in Central and
						South America since graduation. They joke that their
						mothers are co-presidents of the "I Lost My Daughter to
						Latin America" club. Since their untimely separation at
						age 13 they have reconnected in full force&mdash;you
						can't stop a love that lasts forever!</p>
